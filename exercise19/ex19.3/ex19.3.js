// Instructions
// Many times an application needs to verify the account by
// sending a verification code by text message.
// Let's create functionality that enables the user to paste the
// verification code to the input fields.
// Features:
// 1. The user is allowed to type the values manually. After
// each value is inserted, the next input will be focused.

// 2. The user is allowed to paste the verification code.

// 3. An extra challenge will be to auto submit the form once all
// inputs all populated.

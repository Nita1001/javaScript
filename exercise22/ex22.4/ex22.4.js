// Things to think about
// ● We need to update a player’s position by moving the
// ‘active’ class from one ‘td’ to the next one. Of course,
// there are other solutions to implement this game. Using a
// table and a CSS class is one option. But we will stick to
// this one.
// ● We need a way for JavaScript to update the board state.
// Create simple JavaScript functions that update a player’s
// position.
// ● To move the car do not use the click event. Use the
// ‘keyup’ event.
// ● Find a way to announce the winner of the race.
// ● Find a way to restart the game.

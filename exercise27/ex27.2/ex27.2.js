// Write two functions that use Promises that you can chain.
// The first function, makeAllCaps(), will take in an array of words
// and capitalize them, and then the second function, sortWords(),
// will sort the words in alphabetical order. If the array contains
// anything but strings, it should throw an error.
// Call the functions once with an array of words and call it once
// with an array that includes at least one item that is not a word.
// Print the resolve and reject in a .then, .catch.

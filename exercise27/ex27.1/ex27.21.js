// Write a function that takes a number as an argument and
// returns a Promise that tests if the value is less than or greater
// than the value 10.
// If it is greater than 10 it is resolved, if it is less than 10 it is
// rejected.
// Call the function and print the resolve and reject in a .then,
// .catch.
